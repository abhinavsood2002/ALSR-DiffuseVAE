# Codebase for ALSR-VAE Diffusion models

The code in this repository was initially forked from the DiffuseVAE paper repository (https://github.com/kpandey008/DiffuseVAE) and then modified. ALSR-VAE Diffusion demonstrates fine-control of diffusion models across specific attributes. There are 2 datasets the model is trained on - CurlNoise and AbstractArt. CurlNoise contains drawings that are generated by an agent based system, we demonstrate pixel density and size based control on these images. AbstractArt contains images that represent abstract art sourced from Kaggle, we demonstrate control of the structural complexity and color diversity in these images. The mentioned attributes like pixel density are precisely defined in the `attribute_data_generation`. Here are some generated examples:

### Curl Noise Dataset
![variation in pixel density](./Examples/Curl%20Nose/Controllability_pixel_density.png)
*An increase in pixel density - top to bottom where each column represents an example*
![vairation in size](./Examples/Curl%20Nose/Controllability_size.png)
*An increase in size - top to bottom where each column represents an example*

### Abstract Art Dataset
![variation in structural complexity](./Examples/Abstract%20Art/variation_sturcture_appendix.png)
*An increase in structural complexity - top to bottom where each column represents an example*
![variation in color diversity](./Examples/Abstract%20Art/variation_color.png)
*An increase in color diversity - top to bottom where each column represents an example*

## Setup
We used conda as our package manager. The assocaited environment.yml contains the dependencies of this project. An enviroment can be created with
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
## Hyperparameters
We use hydra to manage hyperparameter values. Config examples are available in main/configs/dataset for each dataset.

## Scripts
There are 4 bash scripts. Two for training and testing the AR-VAE and two for training and testing the DDPM. Each of these can be run with
```
bash scripts/script.sh
```
## Important Parameters for generating images.
To generate images using this repository the following parameters have to be configured.
| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ***Data and Checkpoint Paths*** | These need to be set as per the location of the resources in the local machine |
| *scripts/test_ddpm.sh* | |
| `dataset.ddpm.evaluation.eval_mode` | Choose between generation, vae variations, ddpm variations, reconstructions, and alsr varied generations. Has to be one of ["sample", "recons", "alsr", "variations_ddpm", "variations_vae"] | 
| `dataset.vae.evaluation.chkpt_path` | Checkpoint of the VAE used for evaluation |
| `dataset.ddpm.evaluation.chkpt_path` | Checkpoint path for the Diffusion model used for evalution |
| `+dataset=abstractart/test` | Specifies the dataset config used for evaluation |
| *main/configs/dataset/curlnoise/test.yaml* | |
| `ddpm: data: root:` | The location of the images of the dataset used in different evaluations (for example, reconstruction) | 
| | |
| ***Controllability Related parameters*** | Used to control generations |
| *scripts/test_ddpm.sh* | | 
| `dataset.ddpm.evaluation.add_variation` | Amount of DELTA to add for variation along a specific attribute. Can be a float. |
| `dataset.ddpm.evaluation.attribute_index` | Used to specify the latent index of the attribute the variation has to be added to.|
| `dataset.ddpm.evaluation.normal_mean` | Change mean of normal distribution added (to make images more interesting) to latent sample before generation|
| `dataset.ddpm.evaluation.normal_std` |  Change standard deviation of normal distribution added (to make images more interesting) to latent sample before generation|
| | |
| ***Miscellaneous parameters related to image generation*** | These parameters significantly affect how the images are generated | 
| *scripts/test_ddpm.sh* | |
| `dataset.ddpm.evaluation.n_sample` | Number of samples to generate |
| `dataset.ddpm.evaluation.batch_size=4` | Batch size for generation. Bigger batches require more memory |
| `dataset.ddpm.evaluation.sample_method` | Sampling method for the Diffusion Model. Can be ddpm or ddim |
| `dataset.ddpm.evaluation.n_steps` | Number of sampling steps used to sample. |
| `dataset.ddpm.evaluation.skip_strategy'` | Sampling strategy for DDIM. Can be uniform or quad. |
| `dataset.ddpm.evaluation.resample_strategy` | Support for truncated sampling. For DDIM set to spaced. |

## AR-VAE related testing
The VAE generations and metrics and be tested with the ```test_ae.sh``` script.
There are 3 main functionalities offered using clicky:
- sample: sample images from the vae
- sample-with-attributes: sample images while adding variation
- compute-disentanglement-metrics: computed the disentanglement metrics
Example configurations are available in the bash file with parameter configurations
